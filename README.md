# Line Chatbot to search scam Line ID

## About
Due to the increasing threat of scams on LINE, Taiwan’s most popular messaging app, it is crucial for users to easily verify whether a specific account has been reported as a scam.

To try out the chatbot, feel free to add the bot using Line ID: @023crqjc
